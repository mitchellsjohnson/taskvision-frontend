# Cursor Guidelines for TaskVision Frontend

Please follow these rules when assisting with code in this repository:

## Testing
- Always write unit tests for all exported functions, modules, and components.
- Remind us to run `npm test` before any manual testing or deployment.
- Suggest mocking the `useAuth0` hook to simulate different authentication states (e.g., loading, authenticated, unauthenticated) and user roles in tests.

## Auth0 + Security
- Ensure authenticated API calls use `getAccessTokenSilently` to retrieve the user's token.
- Use the `<ProtectedRoute />` and `<RoleProtectedRoute />` components to secure routes that require authentication or specific roles.

## Local Environment
- This project uses a `.env` or `.env.local` file for local environment variables.
- Important: This file is gitignored. Do not assume it doesn't exist. If you suspect an environment variable issue (e.g., with `REACT_APP_API_SERVER_URL`), please ask about its contents rather than concluding it is missing.
